title: Kilian Eichenseer PhD

I am developing novel statistical and computational methods for the Earth Sciences. My academic background lies in Geology and Palaeontology, focussing on marine life and sediments. I became increasingly interested in data science and R programming during my master's and PhD. In my [current PostDoc at Durham University](https://smithlabdurham.github.io/#!research), I build a Bayesian stratigraphic model that can correlate and date geological sections using geochemical signatures. Other projects include [modelling the latitudinal temperature gradient from sparsely sampled climate data](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-1188/), and an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palaeoverse/index.html) enabling [reproducible, efficient workflows for palaeobiological research](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14099).
