Centuries of palaeontological and geological research have produced vast quantities of information on past organisms and environments. Using statistical tools, I am probing these data riches to reconstruct novel aspects of the history of Life. Focal points of my research have been coral reefs, palaeoclimate and the skeletal mineralogy of marine invertebrates. I am currently building a Bayesian stratigraphic model to correlate Cambrian sections using $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C records. (https://smithlabdurham.github.io/#!team).
