summary: The Metropolis algorithm is a simple, but powerful MCMC method. Here, I use it for estimating a generalised logistic function to reconstruct a latitudinal climate gradient from a small sample of temperature estimates.

*The  model presented herein uses modified code from https://khayatrayen.github.io/MCMC.html. I am currently developing a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for stratigraphic correlation of $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C records with Andrew R. Millard and Martin R. Smith at the [Smith Lab at Durham University](https://smithlabdurham.github.io/#!team).*

In the [previous post](/a-metropolis-algorithm-in-r-part-1-generalised-logistic-function), we

[test](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.06134), we developed a Metropolis algorithm to construct a latitudinal temperature gradient from a small sample of temperatures values.
